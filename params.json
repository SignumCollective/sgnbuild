Install sgnbuild from npm\r\n\r\n        npm install --global sgnbuild\r\n\r\n 2. Build\r\n\r\n        sgnbuild\r\n\r\n 3. Install\r\n\r\n        npm install --global\r\n\r\n## Usage instructions\r\n\r\nAll configuration is done within an object called `\"sgnbuild\"` in your project's `package.json`.\r\n\r\n - `sgnbuild.type: string`:\r\n   - `\"web\"`: Build a web application with Rollup, Webpack, and Babel\r\n   - `\"node\"`: Build a Node application with Rollup, outputting CommonJS\r\n   - `\"library\"`: Build a library with Rollup, outputting UMD\r\n - `sgnbuild.root: string`: Directory in which to find `es6/index.js`\r\n - `sgnbuild.global: string`: If `sgnbuild.type` is `\"library\"`, this sets the global to put all exported fields in if the environment is not CommonJS or AMD.\r\n\r\nTake a look at sgnbuild's `package.json` to see an example which is enough for most circumstances:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"sgnbuild\": {\r\n  \"type\": \"node\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
